"How do I take a test at the ARC Testing Center?
","First, complete the initial registration process required for all students to receive accommodations at UTD. 

Second, request your official letter of accommodation for your professors as early in the semester as possible by submitting the online letter request form each semester. 

Third, if your official letter of accommodation does include “Eligible to test in the ARC Testing Center,” complete the online scheduling form for each test, exam, or quiz you want to take with the ARC at least five business days in advance (and two weeks in advance for finals). 

If your letter of accommodation does not include “Eligible to test in the ARC Testing Center” and does include testing accommodation (e.g., extra time, a distraction-reduced environment), you will need to make testing arrangements with your professor, not the ARC.",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
"I’ve taken exams at the ARC before, but now “Eligible to test in the ARC Testing Center” does not appear on my accommodation letter. I want to test at the ARC again.

","Yes.

",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
"My professors said they would send the form in for me or schedule my exams at the ARC. This is OK, right?","No. Students must initiate all requests for accommodated exams at the ARC. If your exam is scheduled by anyone other than you, the reservation will not be accepted and you will need to resubmit the online form personally.

",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
I want to change my reservation or the date of the exam or make a change to a reservation I already submitted. Can I do that?,"If you submitted a reservation for an accommodated test at ARC, you may go back to the scheduling link and choose the option to edit or update reservations. 

Please note that the date or time can be changed only if your professor decided to change the date or time for the entire class. If you are ill or have an emergency and cannot attend, you will need to submit a new reservation for a make-up test at least five days in advance. The professor must approve the new reservation, which is not always guaranteed. If you need to update or change a reservation you made to test outside the ARC, please see your professor.",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
"Why can’t I start my exam on the half hour (e.g., 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m., 3:30 p.m.)?","Due to limitations in space and proctors, we must start all exams on the hour. Please work with professors to adjust your start times.

My professor says they cannot find the space or time for me to take my test with accommodations. Guess I will just take it with the class and hope for the best?,"No! Please do not go without your accommodations if that is not your choice. The ARC will work with you and your professors to find options. 

Do not hesitate to contact the ARC director or assistant director at 972-883-2098.",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
Can I just ask the ARC to get the time or other details from my professor when I fill out the online test form?,"No! Please only fill out the online forms when you have all the details. If you are unsure, ask your professor.

"My professor gives a pop quiz or short test during part of the class period. How does this work with my accommodations?
","Quizzes can be complicated to accommodate, especially if you do not know about them in advance. It’s important to work out the details early in the semester when you see on your syllabus that there will be quizzes in addition to regular exams. 

Many students decide not to use their accommodations on quizzes since they are typically short, and students would have to leave class to go to their eligible testing center. However, it is your choice, and if you do need to use your accommodations, they should be made available to you. 

If you decide you want to use your testing accommodations for quizzes and you know about them in advance, ask the professor if you can take the quiz earlier or later than the class period in a location they provide. If you are eligible to test at the ARC, then you may submit the appropriate test scheduling form. 

If you need a reader, scribe, digital text or any other accommodations that require significant lead time, it is extremely important to discuss these accommodations with the ARC and your professors as soon as possible for quizzes especially pop quizzes. 

The quizzes often are given after class starts; for example, if the class starts at 10 a.m., the test might begin at 10:30 a.m. If you are eligible to take the test at the ARC Testing Center, you are required to start all tests, exams or quizzes on the hour (e.g., 9 a.m., 10 a.m., etc.). In this situation, you will need to get clearance from the professor to take the quiz at any time the ARC Testing Center is open the same date the class takes the quiz or test. 

If you schedule the test earlier or later than the class with the ARC and the professor approves, you will need to begin the test promptly at the start time you reserved. In other words, you cannot schedule a test at 10 a.m. in the ARC then show up at 10:30 a.m. to take the quiz when the rest of the class starts. If you are more than 15 minutes late for your scheduled testing time, you will not be allowed to test. 

Some professors like to discuss the questions on the quiz during class when students are finished. If you arrange to take the quiz after the class due to an accommodation, you must leave the classroom when such discussions occur. 

Faculty are sometimes using quizzes to check attendance (possibly by using clickers). If this is the case, contact the ARC as early as possible so we can work with you and the instructor to identify accommodation options.",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity

I’ve never been asked to do this. Why am I just now seeing a request like this? ,"It is essential to consider this type of new accommodation because the risks associated with the COVID-19 virus can be so great to certain students. 
",https://accessability.utdallas.edu/student-accommodations/frequently-asked-questions/,Student Accesiblity
"Why can’t this student just show up to take tests? 
","The documentation provided by the student indicates substantial risk for being in crowds and environments that potentially create significant viral spread; therefore, even coming to class just to take an exam would not be reasonable.
