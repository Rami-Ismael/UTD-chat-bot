5,what do i do if I have a disability," First, apply to the University of Texas at Dallas. Next, if you need to request accommodations due to a disability, you will need to submit documentation to the AccessAbility Resource Center. After that, the Center will review your documentation and determine your eligibility for services. If you are eligible, they will create an individualized service plan to meet your needs. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive, so it is important to submit your documentation as early as possible."
6,What accommodations are there for people with ADHD?," The first step is to get diagnosed by a professional if you think you might have ADHD. If you have not been diagnosed with ADHD, the university cannot provide any type of academic accommodations. 

There are a couple of types of academic accommodations that might be appropriate for students with ADHD. These include extended time for test taking, note takers, and the use of assistive technology. 

If you have been diagnosed with ADHD, the next step is to register with the AccessAbility Resource Center. You will need to provide documentation of your diagnosis from a professional to be eligible for accommodations. 

Once you are registered, you will meet with a staff member to discuss your accommodations. The staff member will work with you to identify which accommodations would be appropriate for you. Not all students with ADHD will need or want the same accommodations. 

It is important to remember that accommodations are not retroactive. This means that if you take a test without using your accommodations and then decide you want to use them, you will not be able to go back and retake the test with your accommodations. 

You will also need to talk to your professor about your accommodations. It is important to have this conversation early in the semester so that your professor knows what accommodations"
