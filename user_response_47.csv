0,i have a disability - where can I go to UTD for help?,"

First, youâ€™ll want to make an appointment with the Counseling and Psychological Services Center (CAPS). 

When you come in for your appointment, the clinician will ask you questions about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. They will also ask about your family, your medical history, and your academic history. This information helps the clinician get a general sense of your presenting problem.

After the CAPS clinician has gathered this general information, they will work with you to identify your specific goals for therapy. Together, you and the clinician will decide what kind of therapy would be most helpful for you."
